<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

 <div align="center">

</div>

This project demonstrates a decentralized application (dApp) built on blockchain technology, designed for storing and sharing images securely. It allows users with Ethereum accounts to upload images to the platform and share them with others. The images are stored on the InterPlanetary File System (IPFS), a decentralized peer-to-peer network, with the help of Pinata, a popular IPFS service provider. To enhance security and user control, the Ethereum blockchain records every event related to data transfer and access as a transaction, ensuring transparency and tamper-proof operations.

The application features a React-based front-end, offering a user-friendly interface for seamless interactions. The core functionality of the dApp is powered by smart contracts written in Solidity, deployed on the Ethereum blockchain. For local blockchain development and testing, the project uses Hardhat as the runtime environment. Additionally, Node.js is used to manage the React app, while users connect to the blockchain via the MetaMask browser extension, which acts as a digital wallet.

The application empowers users with several capabilities. They can upload images to the decentralized IPFS network, view their stored images, and securely grant access to their data to other users. The dApp also allows users to access images shared by others by providing the corresponding Ethereum addresses. Furthermore, users can manage their data access permissions by viewing the list of authorized users and revoking access for specific individuals if needed.

Overall, this project highlights the integration of blockchain and IPFS technologies to create a secure and transparent platform for decentralized data storage and sharing. It serves as a proof-of-concept for leveraging blockchain's immutable nature and decentralized storage to provide better user control and security in data sharing applications. <p align="right">(<a href="#readme-top">back to top</a>)</p>
